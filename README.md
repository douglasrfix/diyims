do it yourself independent media services

# What is a media service anyway?

At the moment, it is the publisher role. This implies transmission of content,
not necessarily creation of content. This may be packaging of content from creators and advertisers.  It would
mean revenue creation via subscribers and/or advertisers. It would mean paying the content providers.

In this context, an independent publisher might be likened to a one man print shop. Think Benjamin Franklin.

This started out as a project to replace the one man local newspaper. It
needs an text editor, non text media manager. Storage space and
distribution capability to a set of subscribers. It would be nice to be
able to generate voice from the text as well.
